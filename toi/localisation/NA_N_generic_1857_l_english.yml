### LANCER'S STUFF FUCK OFF ###

nativeindustrial.1.t:0 "Trading tomahawk for wrench."
nativeindustrial.1.d:0 "When one thinks 'native american', the next thing to follow isn't normally 'keen mechanical engineer'. However, with a surplus of disused railroads left by the Americans after their eviction, a group of the latest products from our new school system have taken it upon themselves to build trains and wagons for them. Who knows? Maybe they'll even make those new horseless carriages that are popular in Europe at the moment aswell."
nativeindustrial.1.a:0 "Interesting"

nativeindustrial.2.t:0 "A different kind of smoke signal."
nativeindustrial.2.d:0 "When the Yankees left, they left behind a network of telegraph cables that needed managing. Sioux Telegraphy was started to manage these and run sevices between towns, but has since grown much larger to become the main source of electronic research in the area. Last we heard, they had a simple eletromechanical computer up and running, acting as an automatic switchboard for urban telephone connections in the capital city."
nativeindustrial.2.a:0 "First by cable, soon by air."

nativeindustrial.3.t:0 "The genius of the plains."
nativeindustrial.3.d:0 "Wilson Red-Fox was the chief of a large village in south dakota, and a hobby chemist who experimented with synthesizing chemicals in his spare time with books he had found whilst raiding settlers. He is now considered an era-defining genius by many, having developed the Wilson Process, a method of extracting celluloid polymers from corn and wheat agricultural waste. His chemical business now manufactures everything from industrial pesticides to plastics and synthetic rubbers."
nativeindustrial.3.a:0 "He is rather clever, isn't he?"

nativeindustrial.4.t:0 "From slave to master."
nativeindustrial.4.d:0 "William 'Big Billy' Watts was born a slave and grew up a slave. But, in the chaos of the collapse of the confederation he was able to escape to Texas, where he started a small drilling well with what little he had in the budding oil industry. Now, he owns fields of wells and several large prototype refineries. One of the true rags-to-riches stories, palm petro-chemical specialises in petroleum chemistr and resource recovery, branching out from oil into mineral and lumber resources too."
nativeindustrial.4.a:0 "The dream of the entrepeneur lives on."

nativeindustrial.5.t:0 "From failed gloves to vehicle parts"
nativeindustrial.5.d:0 "The golden tyre company didn't start making tyres, they started making gloves for the new generation of factory workers and builders. However, these were never popular with workmen as the vulcanised rubber was stiff and cracked with use. This rubber, with the advent of the motor vehicle, proved useful for making hard-wearing road tyres useful for military and agricultural settings."
nativeindustrial.5.a:0 "Be careful with rubber cheques, they bounce."

nativeindustrial.6.t:0 "Flight of the zephyr."
nativeindustrial.6.d:0 "The word of the day is powered flight, as Miss Doe's 'Zephyr' mark 1 flying machine pleases the crowds as it becomes the first powered aircraft to cross the grand canyon."

nativediplomatic.1.d:0 "The new native state is like a debutante first entering high society. The ballroom of the world is a daunting place, full of ne'er do wells, but seeing off the united states will surely have made your position on colonists explicitly clear. So the only thing that matters now is who's tune you dance to. Dance."
nativediplomatic.1.a:0 "Extrovertion"
