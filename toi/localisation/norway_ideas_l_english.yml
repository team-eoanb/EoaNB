 NOR_idea_swedish_norwegian_union:0 "Swedish-Norwegian Union"
 NOR_idea_swedish_norwegian_union_desc:0 "Kielfreden was concluded on January 14, 1814, between Sweden and Denmark and was forced by the Swedish heir to the throne Karl Johan who was commander-in-chief of the Allied Northern Army in the war against Napoleon I. After the battle of Leipzig in 1813, he returned with his army to Denmark. According to the peace treaty in Kiel, the Danish king ceded Norway to the king of Sweden, while Sweden ceded Swedish Pomerania and Rügen to Denmark and paid one million riksdaler to Denmark. According to the first draft of the peace treaty, the whole of Norway would be transferred to Sweden, but in the final treaty, the Norwegian autonomy countries, Greenland, Iceland and the Faroe Islands were excluded, which now instead became Danish. This, that Norway would be part of what they called a forced union with Sweden and also lose their autonomy countries, that caused great anger among many in Norway. On May 17, 1814, the Norwegian constitution (based on Montesquieu's doctrine of the division of power) was adopted in Eidsvoll and the elected assembly then elected the Danish Crown Prince Kristian Fredrik (later Kristian VIII of Denmark) as Norwegian king. But without foreign support, the new regime could not, in the long run, stand up to Karl Johan's demands for the fulfilment of the Kiel Treaty, and after a short military intervention (Sweden's latest war) had to give way. At the Convention in Moss on 14 August, a ceasefire was concluded, and Kristian Fredrik gave consent to an abdication against Norway being allowed to keep its constitution in a personnel union with Sweden. He abdicated and left the country on October 10, after handing over government power to the Storting. On November 4, 1814, the Norwegian Storting and the Swedish negotiators agreed on the terms, and a revised Norwegian constitution was adopted and Charles XIII (in Norway Charles II) was elected King of Norway. According to the Union Treaty, Norway would be united with Sweden in a union as its own kingdom with its own laws and ordinances but with a common royal house and a common foreign policy led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Stockholm."
 NOR_idea_pm_in_stockholm:0 "Norwegian Prime Minister in Stockholm"
 NOR_idea_pm_in_stockholm_desc:0 "The Norwegian Prime Minister in Stockholm is a public official elected by the Swedish king. His job is to relay the reqests of the Norwegian government directly to the Swedish king."

 NOR_idea_storting:0 "The Norwegian Storting"
 NOR_idea_storting_desc:0 "The Storting, an institution founded with the 1814 constitution. As the Norwegian parliament, it represents a free Norway without the influence of the Swedish.\nIt is divided into two chambers: the Lagting, the upper house and court of impeachment, and the Odelsting, the lower house and legeslative chamber. After an election, 3/4 of the elected reperesentatives join the Odelsting while 1/4 join the Lagting. Because both chambers are filled with reperesentatives from the same election, there are rarely any ideological difference between the two. Therefore, most bills that are sent to the Lagting are mostly approved without any revisions."

 NOR_idea_state_of_workers:0 "State of the Workers"
 NOR_idea_state_of_workers_desc:0 "The workers in Norway, like in most countries in the world, work and live in bad conditions. The condition in many of the workplaces are bad, and adding to that, dangerous machines have little to no protection. Workers are also not supplied with safety gear, so a small problem can be quite damaging. If the workers have it too bad, they might radicalize and start to develop dangerous ideas! We should keep them satisfied enough to prevent conflict."

 NOR_idea_embedsmannstaten:0 "Embedsmannstaten"
 NOR_idea_embedsmannstaten_desc:0 "According to the constitution of 1814, Norway is a democracy, although in reality it is an autocracy. This is because the country is controlled by a powerful ruling class, centered around the Swedish king. The King has the power to appoint the Prime Minister of his choice, and therefore Norway is in reality a puppet of the Swedish Crown. Because of this, there exists a struggle between the liberal parliamentarians and the conservative embedsmenn, where the Norwegian parliament, the Storting, wants more control over the Norwegian government."
